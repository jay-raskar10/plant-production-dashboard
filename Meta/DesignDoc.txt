PRODUCT DESIGN DOCUMENT
Project Name: Nexus Production Intelligence (NPI) Dashboard Version: 1.0 (Final Draft) Target Platform: Web Desktop / Tablet (Responsive) Visual References: Cloud MES (Layout/Status) & DreamsEMR (Data Structure/Tables)

1. Executive Summary
The NPI Dashboard is a centralized data visualization tool for a mechanical spares manufacturing company. It serves two distinct purposes:

Real-Time Monitoring: Allowing supervisors to see the live status of production lines across different cities.

Historical Analysis: Allowing engineers to drill down into specific stations, view granular data tables, and export reports.

2. Information Architecture & Hierarchy
The system uses a "Global Context Filter" approach. The user selects the location context first, which dictates the data shown below.

2.1 The Data Hierarchy
Level 1: Plant Location

Options: Pune, Chennai (Expandable for future).

Level 2: Production Line

Options: FCPV, LACV, Compressor Line.

Level 3: Station/Asset

Options: All Stations (Overview) OR Specific Station (e.g., "OP-10 Turning", "OP-20 Milling").

3. Detailed Screen Specifications
3.1 Global Navigation Bar (Sticky Top)
Left: App Logo ("Nexus").

Center (Context Selectors):

Dropdown 1 [Plant]: Default "Pune".

Dropdown 2 [Line]: Default "FCPV".

Action: Changing these instantly refreshes the main view.

Right: User Profile, Settings, Global Notifications.

3.2 View A: The "Whole Line" Dashboard
Trigger: User selects a Plant and Line, but does not select a specific station.

Visual Style Reference: Cloud MES Dashboard (Clean cards, status indicators).

Key Components:

KPI Ribbon (Top):

Total Line Output: (e.g., 1,250 parts).

Line OEE: (e.g., 87%).

Active Alerts: (e.g., 2 Critical).

Station Grid (Main Body):

A visual representation of the line flow.

Each station is a Card containing:

Station Name (e.g., OP-10).

Live Status Indicator: Green (Running), Red (Fault), Grey (Idle).

Real-time Counter: Parts produced today.

Current Cycle Time: Live readout (e.g., 42s).

Interaction: Clicking any Station Card takes the user to View B.

3.3 View B: The "Specific Station" Analytics
Trigger: User clicks a station card OR selects a specific station from a dropdown.

Visual Style Reference: DreamsEMR Dashboard (Tabbed views, detailed lists, clear export actions).

Layout Structure:

A. The Control Toolbar
Date Filter: [ Today | Yesterday | Last 7 Days | Custom Date Range ].

View Toggle: A segmented control switch: [ 📈 Graph View ] vs [ 📄 Table View ].

Export Actions:

[Icon: PDF] "Export Report"

[Icon: Excel] "Download CSV/XLSX"

B. Mode 1: Graph View (Visual Analysis)
Primary Chart: A large Area or Line chart showing Production Output vs. Time.

Multi-Graph Overlay Options: Checkboxes to toggle additional data lines on the same chart:

[x] Production Count

[ ] Cycle Time Spikes

[ ] Temperature/Pressure (Telemetry)

Live Mode Toggle: A switch to "Go Live."

Action: Disables date picker, graph updates every 2 seconds (simulating an oscilloscope/heartbeat monitor).

C. Mode 2: Table View (Data Records)
Structure: A high-density data table (similar to the Medical Records reference).

Columns:

Timestamp: (DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS)

Part Serial ID: (Unique Identifier)

Status: (OK / NOK / Rework) - Color coded text.

Cycle Time: (e.g., 45.2s)

Operator ID: (Who was logged in).

Features: Pagination (Page 1 of 50), Sort by Column headers.

4. Export Functionality
PDF Export: Generates a "Management Report."

Includes: Snapshot of the current visible Graph, summary of KPIs for the selected date range, and a list of top 5 downtime errors.

Excel Export: Generates a "Raw Data Dump."

Includes: All rows from the Table View for the selected date range.

5. Visual Style Guide (UI System)
Color Palette
Background: #F4F7FE (Soft Blue-Grey - reduces eye strain).

Cards/Containers: #FFFFFF (White with subtle shadow).

Primary Action Color: #4318FF (Deep Blue - from MES reference).

Status Colors (The "Traffic Light"):

Running/OK: #05CD99 (Vivid Green).

Warning/Idle: #FFB547 (Amber).

Fault/Error: #E31A1A (Alert Red).

Typography
Font Family: DM Sans or Inter (Google Fonts).

Reasoning: Highly legible for numbers and data tables.

6. Functional Requirements for Developers
Latency: Live dashboard status must update within <3 seconds of real-time events.

Responsiveness: Layout must adapt.

Desktop: 4 Station Cards per row.

Tablet: 2 Station Cards per row.

Data Handling:

Graphing Library Recommendation: Recharts or ApexCharts (React).

Table Library Recommendation: TanStack Table (for sorting/filtering).
